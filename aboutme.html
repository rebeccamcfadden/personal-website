                        <p>
                            I am a sophomore at Texas A&M majoring in
                            computer science with a minor in embedded system design. I am an officer for the
                            A&M branch of <a href="https://women.acm.org/">ACM-W</a>, Aggie Women in Computer Science (<a href="https://www.awics.org">AWiCS</a>) and I am involved in
                            many other students groups on campus, such as Dance Arts Society and Hullabaloo Band.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Outside of school, I enjoy painting, reading, cooking/baking, dance, and tinkering with Raspberry Pis.
                            Though all of those are generally indoor activities, I like to spend a fair amount of time outdoors, whether
                            that be running, hiking, or just sitting by the pool at my apartment.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After I graduate, I hope to move back to my home area of Washington D.C. or along the East Coast to spend more time 
                            with my three siblings and my family. 
                            While I don't have a specific company or focus area in computer science that I'd like to pursue at this time,
                            I hope to work on a project or team that showcases the "magic" of technology to the world. I came to computer science 
                            from aerospace/mechanical engineering because I was inspired at a young age by theme park attraction design and animatronics.
                            As I got older, that fascination found a new subject in the form of space travel after having witnessed the final fly-in of the
                            Discovery space shuttle to Washington Dulles Airport. Yet when I started taking college classes, I found my interest pulled by
                            my computer science minor classes and I eventually made the switch. Therefore, my goal is to find a job that combines my 
                            inspirations with the field I enjoy.
